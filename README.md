# Henrique Augusto Maltauro

I'm Full Stack Developer, working with this focus since 2021 and as a developer since 2016.  
My main knowledge in the back-end is with .net C# and front-end with Angular.  
I have also been developing knowledge in NodeJs with TypeScript, and delving into Software Architecture and data structure.
